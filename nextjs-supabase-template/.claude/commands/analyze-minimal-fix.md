# Minimal Solution Analysis

I need help analyzing a code problem and finding the simplest possible fix.

**Instructions:**
1. First, ask me to describe the specific problem I'm struggling with
2. Ask for any additional context about what's currently happening vs. what should happen
3. Ask which files you should review to understand the issue
4. After I provide the files, analyze them carefully
5. Propose the absolute simplest, most minimal solution that requires the least code changes

**Important constraints:**
- We want to change as little code as possible
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Maintain existing code patterns
- Focus on the minimal fix that achieves the desired outcome

**Do NOT write any code yet** - only provide:
- Your understanding of the root cause
- Your proposed solution approach
- Which files need changes and why
- Step-by-step plan for the minimal fix
- Reasoning for why this is the simplest approach

Start by asking me about the problem I'm facing.
